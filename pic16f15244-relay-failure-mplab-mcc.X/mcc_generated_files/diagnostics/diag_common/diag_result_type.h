/**
 @enum diag_result_t
 @brief Contains return codes for the diagnostic tests.
 @var diag_result_t:: DIAG_PASS
 0x81U - Indicates that no Fault was detected by the diagnostic.
 @var diag_result_t:: DIAG_FAIL
 0x42U - Indicates that a Fault was detected by the diagnostic.
 @var diag_result_t:: DIAG_INVALID_ARG
 0x24U - Indicates that the diagnostic was unsuccessful due 
 to one or more invalid input arguments when calling the function.
 @var diag_result_t:: DIAG_UNDEFINED
 0x7EU - Indicates that the result of the diagnostic is undefined 
 due to incorrect usage of the API.
 @var diag_result_t:: DIAG_NVM_STORE_ERROR
 0xBDU  - Indicates that the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) controller reported an error when 
 attempting to write a value to nonvolatile memory.

 @note The enum values are chosen with a specific bit pattern to not
 overlap with the March diagnostic data backgrounds and avoid
 accidentally reporting an incorrect result.
