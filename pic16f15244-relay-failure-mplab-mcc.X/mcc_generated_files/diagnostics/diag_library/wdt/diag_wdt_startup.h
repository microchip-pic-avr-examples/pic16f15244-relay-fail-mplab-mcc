 * @ingroup diag_wdt_startup
 * @brief This API checks the WDT resets when the timer is being cleared either too early or too late.
 * This test will not be called from main. It will be executed before main is entered, as long as 
 * diag_wdt_startup.h/.c and powerup_xx.as are included in the compilation.
 * This is the simple timer based WDT self-diagnostic test.
 * It tests that the WDT resets the device when the WDT counter is not cleared. 
 * The next step tests that the WDT counter will be cleared without resetting the device. 
 * Once this is confirmed, the device is again reset by the WDT. 
 * This function tests the following:
 * 1. WDT issues a system Reset after time-out.
 * 2. WDT timing and that it can be cleared.
 *
 * The expected (error-free) execution flow:
 * 1. Power-On Reset or External Reset has occurred
 * 2. Check that WDT can issue a system Reset. Set test state to Simple Timer and system Reset
 * 3. Check that WDT can be cleared
 * 4. Set test state to "ok" and continue to main()
 * TMR0 is used as an independent clock source to the WDT clock, which is
 * used to check the timing of the oscillator used by the WDT.
 * If the device and WDT was Reset correctly in each step of the test, then the @ref diag_wdt_teststate is set to
 * @ref DIAG_WDT_FSM_OK and @ref diag_wdt_status is set to @ref DIAG_PASS, otherwise the @ref diag_wdt_teststate is set to @ref DIAG_WDT_FAULT
 * and @ref diag_wdt_status is set to @ref DIAG_FAIL thereby indicating fault.
 * Error reporting:
 * Call @ref DIAG_WDT_GetResult() from main to see the status of the WDT diagnosis.
 * @param None.
 * @return See @ref DIAG_WDT_GetResult()
