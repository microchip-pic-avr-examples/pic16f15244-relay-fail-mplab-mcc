 * values and are later updated or monitored by the @ref DIAG_INT_Frequency function.
 * @param [in] intId - Unique ID for the interrupt to be monitored
 * @param [in] refCount - Number of interrupts expected to occur within a given monitoring period
 * @param [in] tolerance - Tolerance band for the number of interrupts which occur in the defined Fault Detection Time Interval (FDTI)
 * @param [in] fdtiCount - Count to derive the FDTI for the interrupt registered for monitoring.
 *                    FDTI is the time interval between the occurrence of a Fault and its detection.
 *                    This count gets decremented every time the reference ISR is called.
 *                    When this counter reaches 1, it is time to check the intr_counter with the
 *                    expected intr_ref_counter for the interrupt under test with the given intr_counter_tolerance.
 * @return @ref DIAG_PASS - Given interrupt source is registered successfully \n
