 @ingroup diag_cpu_register
 @brief Validates the CPU Registers for stuck bits and coupling faults.
The registers are tested in the following order:
 1. WREG
 2. WREG_SHAD
 3. BSR_SHAD
 4. FSR0L_SHAD
 5. FSR0H_SHAD
 6. FSR1L_SHAD
 7. FSR1H_SHAD
 8. BSR
 9. FSR\n
 This test checks the integrity of the registers by testing for stuck bits and coupling faults, ensuring that the bits
 in the registers are not stuck at a value. The test can be done successively doing a write, read and 
 check of 0x55 and 0xAA value into the CPU registers.
 The register is saved into RAM before the test is performed and restored after the test is done.
 @param None.
 @return DIAG_PASS - indicates that CPU Register test did not detect a fault.
 @return DIAG_FAIL - indicates that CPU Register detected a fault.
