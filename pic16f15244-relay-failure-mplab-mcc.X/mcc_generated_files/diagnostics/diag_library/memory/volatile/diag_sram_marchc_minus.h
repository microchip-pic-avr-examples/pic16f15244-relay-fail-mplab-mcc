/**
 @ingroup diag_sram_marchc_minus
 @brief Implements the March C- test on the SRAM.
It is a complete and irredundant test capable of detecting stuck-at faults,
addressing faults, transition faults, and coupling faults.
Since this test is a destructive test, a buffer must be provided
to save and restore user memory during the test.

March C- test algorithm is executed in six steps:
Step 1: Ascending(w0)
Step 2: Ascending(r0, w1)
Step 3: Ascending(r1, w0)
Step 4: Descending(r0, w1)
Step 5: Descending(r1, w0)
Step 6: Ascending(r0)

@param [in] startAddress Address of the first SRAM location to test
@param [in] length Number of bytes to test
@param [in] bufferAddress Address of buffer where user data will be stored during test

@return @ref DIAG_PASS - No faults detected
@return @ref DIAG_FAIL - Fault detected
@return @ref DIAG_INVALID_ARG - Invalid length or address is passed to this function
